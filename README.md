# Issue Tracker

This is a simple Angular application for managing and tracking issues using reactive forms and the Clarity Design System.

The purpose of this project is to learn and improve my skills in frontend development using Angular.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.14.

## Demo

Below you can see a demo of this project. Basically, the user can see a list of the issues in a table where they can sort and filter. They can create a new issue, edit an existing one, and resolve an issue too. This uses a simple extra and turns on suggestions when reporting an issue to help users avoid duplicate entries.
